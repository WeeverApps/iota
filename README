Really Simple Semantic Syndication (R3S) Draft Specifications
=============================================================

Version:		0.9.1
Author: 		Robert Gerald Porter
Copyright: 		2011 Weever Apps Inc.

Revision History:

0.8: 	Initial Publication
0.8.1:	Addition of Geolocational Data to main feed specs
0.9:	Addition of profile specs, subcategorizations through channel content-type.
0.9.1:	Addition of fullContent feeds

Background: 

R3S was born of the necessity for a standard by which a web application could transmit any public data via a protocol that is lightweight, widely accessible, and easily transformed by a third-party application. While developing Weever, I discovered that RSS was far too limited and slow in many ways.

For instance, RSS requires XML parsing -- this is both slow and inconsitent in Javascript. RSS is often limited to only the latest data, and that data tends to be inconsistent across implementations: some giving full feed with complete content, some only giving introductory text. Ultimately, if we were to have something elegant and efficient, something else was needed.

What follows is our first implementation of the specification Weever uses to translate website data into a mobile HTML5 web app. We know that some day, maybe soon, websites may also need to relay data to other types of applications in an Internet of Things.

In our current implementations, most of the object space remains unused. In particular, the semanic "relationships" property is one we are quite keen to use some day for giving context to an object.

Specifications:
===============

Channel
=======

An R3S channel only delivers metadata related to a particular query. An R3S reader would then re-request details about a particular object once it is determined by the user what they wish to explore.

type: 			What kind of content is being returned (html, media, etc)

sort: 			How the items are sorted (alphabetic, most recent, etc)

language: 		Localization of the content (en-us, etc)

copyright: 		Copyright statement for the content

license: 		Any licensing pertaining to the content (Creative Commons, GPL, etc)

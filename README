Internet of Things Aggregation (IoTA) feed Draft Specifications
===============================================================

Version:		0.9.4
Author: 		Robert Gerald Porter
Copyright: 		2011-2014 Weever Apps Inc.

Revision History:

0.8: 	Initial Publication
0.8.1:	Addition of Geolocational Data to main feed specs
0.9:	Addition of profile specs, subcategorizations through channel content-type.
0.9.1:	Addition of fullContent feeds
0.9.2:	Addition of htmlPreview feed
0.9.3:  Name changed from "R3S" to "IoTA"
0.9.4:  Added optional "actions" item to feed items and details.

Background: 

IoTA was born of the necessity for a standard by which a web application could transmit any public data via a protocol that is lightweight, widely accessible, and easily transformed by a third-party application. While developing Weever, I discovered that RSS was far too limited and slow in many ways.

For instance, RSS requires XML parsing -- this is both slow and inconsitent in Javascript. RSS is often limited to only the latest data, and that data tends to be inconsistent across implementations: some giving full feed with complete content, some only giving introductory text. Ultimately, if we were to have something elegant and efficient, something else was needed.

What follows is our first implementation of the specification Weever uses to translate website data into a mobile HTML5 web app. We know that some day, maybe soon, websites may also need to relay data to other types of applications in an Internet of Things.

In our current implementations, most of the object space remains unused. In particular, the semanic "relationships" property is one we are quite keen to use some day for giving context to an object.

Specifications:
===============

Channel
=======

An IoTA channel only delivers metadata related to a particular query. An IoTA reader would then re-request details about a particular object once it is determined by the user what they wish to explore.
